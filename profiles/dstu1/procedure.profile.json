A procedure is an activity that is performed with or on a patient as part of the provision of care. Examples include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic procedures, biopsies, and exclude things for which there are specific resources, such as immunizations, drug administrations. \r\n\r\nNote that many diagnostic processes are procedures that generate observations and reports. In many cases, the existence of the procedure is assumed, but where there are details of interest about how the diagnostic procedure was performed, the procedure resource is used to describe the activity.",

	"requirements": "Scope and Usage Allergy/Intolerance resources are used to provide information about adverse sensitivities to substances that lead to physiologic changes that are clinically observable. An adverse sensitivity is defined as: \r\n\r\nA condition expected to result in undesirable physiologic reaction to an amount of a substance that would not produce a reaction in most individuals. The substance is the trigger of an immunologic response that produces the observed physiologic changes, or in some instances nonimmunologic mechanisms that produce clinically identical physiologic changes. The immunologic response might be considered the actual cause of the reaction, but it is exposure to the trigger substance that is clinically observable. \r\n\r\nThis definition excludes clinically identical episodes that may be caused by physical agents, such as heat, cold, sunlight, or vibration, by exercise activity, or by infectious agents. Those conditions caused by physical agents or infectious would be captured on the problem list (List/Condition Resources). The allergy/intolerance list is a list of conditions that represent a propensity unique to this individual for a reaction upon future exposure to a specified substance. \r\n\r\nNote that this specification draws a distinction between the patients condition/problem list and an allergy/intolerance list, even though allergies and intolerances are also conditions. This is because the distinction is a long established clinical workflow, even to patients. Asking an individual \"if they have any problems\" is not going to invoke an account of their past reactions to medications or foods. Instead, they are asked if they \"have any allergies\". An allergy/intolerance is also different in that a potential harm from exposure to an external substance that may be ordered by a provider in the course of their care but is not inherent to exposure to that substance for the general population.",

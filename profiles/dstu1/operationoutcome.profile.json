They are provided as a direct system response, or component of one, where they provide information about the outcome of the operation. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, OperationOutcomes are used in the following circumstances: \r\n\r\n* When an RESTful operation fails\r\n* As the response on a validation operation, to provide information about the outcomes\r\n* As part of a message response, usually when the message has not been processed correctly",
